- Introduce :mod:`gidgethub.actions`.
- Add :exc:`gidgethub.ValidationError` for when the HTTP response is a 422 but not

  not found in the headers.
- Allow authenticating as a GitHub App by using JSON web token.
  :func:`gidgethub.sansio.create_headers` now accepts
  ``jwt`` argument. ``gidgethub.abc.GitHubAPI._make_request``,
  :meth:`gidgethub.abc.GitHubAPI.getitem`, :meth:`gidgethub.abc.GitHubAPI.getiter`,
  :meth:`gidgethub.abc.GitHubAPI.post`, :meth:`gidgethub.abc.GitHubAPI.patch`,

-----

- Expand :meth:`gidgethub.routing.Router.dispatch`.


2.3.0
-----

- Add support for ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` webhook event payloads.

  currently does not do that.)

  asynchronous callbacks.

- Add type hints.

- Add a *cache* argument to :class:`gidgethub.abc.GitHubAPI`.

- Introduce :mod:`gidgethub.tornado` to support
  `Tornado <http://www.tornadoweb.org/>`_ (thanks to
  Matthias Bussonnier and A. Jesse Jiryu Davis for the PR reviews).


2.1.0
-----

- The default value for the *data* argument of :meth:`gidgethub.abc.GitHubAPI.put`
  was changed from ``""`` to ``b""``.
- All type hints were removed (due to mypy not supporting yield in an async
  function, they were not being tested as being valid).


2.0.0
-----

- Renamed ``gidgethub.abc.GitHubAPI._sleep()`` to
  :meth:`~gidgethub.abc.GitHubAPI.sleep()` to make the method public.
- Renamed the "test" extra to "tests" and added the "dev" extra.
- Introduced the :exc:`gidgethub.RateLimitExceeded` exception.
- Methods on :class:`gidgethub.abc.GitHubAPI` no longer automatically sleep when it's
  possible that the call will exceed the user's rate limit (it's now up to the
  user to prevent from going over the rate limit).
- Made the ``[treq]`` install extra depend on ``Twisted[tls]``.


1.2.0
-----

- :meth:`gidgethub.sansio.Event.from_http` raises a :exc:`gidgethub.BadRequest` of ``415``
  instead of ``400`` when a content-type other than ``application/json``
  is provided.
- More robustly decode the body in :meth:`gidgethub.sansio.Event.from_http`
  (i.e. if the ``content-type`` doesn't specify ``charset``, assume ``UTF-8``).
- Changed the signature of :class:`gidgethub.sansio.Event` to accept
  :data:`typing.Any` for the *data* argument.
- Fixed signature verification.


1.1.0
-----

- Introduced ``gidgethub.treq`` (thanks to Cory Benfield).
